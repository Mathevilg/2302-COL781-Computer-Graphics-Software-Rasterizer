Software Rasterization
We implemented a rasterization library in software that emulates the way 3D scenes are rendered on the GPU. Our software rasterizer should supports the following features that we have covered in the course: triangle rasterization, supersampling, affine and perspective transformations, z-buffering, and perspective-correct interpolation.
